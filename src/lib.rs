/*
    This library aims to implement Bitcoin transactions.

    Please do not broadcast transactions created with this
    library unless you are 100% confident.

    Todo:
        - Sig module
                - Verify txns with sighashes

        - Serialization module
                - Serialize integers into byte arrays (big or little endian)
                - Serialize inputs, outputs, signatures and entire transactions.
        
        - Hash module
                - Create wrapper functions around crypto-rs library hash methods
                   for hashes used in the creation of transactions (double sha256)

        - Creating transactions
                - Creating tx's with empty* scriptSigs to sign
                - Creating locking and unlocking scripts
                - Start by making transactions that take in 1 input.
                   Then exapand to multiple inputs.
                   Ref (How to sign a Tx with multiple inputs with sighash all) https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/41209/how-to-sign-a-transaction-with-multiple-inputs/88281?noredirect=1#comment101253_88281
                - Write code to create transactions given a UTXO(s), receipient pub key hash, and amount to send.
                   This shouldn't be too hard. It will involve:
                        - Creating the blanket tx with the inputs and ouputs. However, the scriptSig of the inputs will be empty.
                        - Sign each input with the priv key needed to unlock it by putting the input's pub key hash in the script sig.
                        - Start by using the SigHash All (can do other sighashes later)
                        - Once all inputs are signed, serialize transaction.
